# Pokemon Card Game Architecture

## Overview

The Pokemon Card Game is implemented as a blockchain-based trading card game supporting both EVM-compatible chains and Solana. The architecture consists of multiple smart contracts that handle different aspects of the game.

## Architecture Components

### EVM Implementation (Solidity)

#### Core Contracts

1. **PokemonCardNFT** (`PokemonCardNFT.sol`)
   - ERC721 NFT contract for Pokemon cards
   - Handles card minting, ownership, and metadata
   - Manages player collections and card counts
   - Implements card active/inactive status for battles

2. **PokemonBattle** (`PokemonBattle.sol`)
   - Manages turn-based Pokemon battles
   - Handles battle creation, joining, and execution
   - Implements energy system and move execution
   - Manages battle rewards and timeouts

3. **PokemonTrading** (`PokemonTrading.sol`)
   - Facilitates peer-to-peer card trading
   - Supports both public and targeted offers
   - Implements offer expiration and cleanup
   - Handles trading fees and validation

4. **PokemonGameFactory** (`PokemonGameFactory.sol`)
   - Factory contract for deploying all game contracts
   - Manages contract configurations
   - Provides centralized administration functions
   - Handles contract upgrades and maintenance

#### Data Structures

- **PokemonTypes.sol**: Shared data structures and enums
- **PokemonCard**: Complete Pokemon card data including stats, moves, and metadata
- **Battle**: Battle state including participants, status, and turn management
- **TradingOffer**: Trading offer data with expiration and validation

### Solana Implementation (Rust/Anchor)

#### Program Structure

1. **Main Program** (`lib.rs`)
   - Single program handling all game functionality
   - Uses Anchor framework for Solana development
   - Implements PDA (Program Derived Address) pattern
   - Handles all game operations in one contract

#### Account Types

1. **GameState**
   - Global game configuration and statistics
   - Tracks total cards, battles, and trades
   - Stores game parameters and fees

2. **PokemonCard**
   - Individual Pokemon card data
   - Contains stats, moves, and metadata
   - Linked to owner and minting information

3. **PlayerState**
   - Player-specific data and statistics
   - Tracks card count, active battles, and energy
   - Maintains win/loss records

4. **Battle**
   - Battle state and participants
   - Manages turn order and Pokemon teams
   - Tracks battle progress and completion

5. **TradingOffer**
   - Trading offer data and validation
   - Handles offer expiration and acceptance
   - Manages card transfers

## Game Mechanics

### Card System

- **Pokemon Types**: 18 different types (Normal, Fire, Water, Grass, etc.)
- **Rarity Levels**: 5 tiers (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary)
- **Evolution Stages**: 3 stages (Basic, Stage 1, Stage 2)
- **Stats**: HP, Attack, Defense, Speed
- **Moves**: Physical, Special, and Status moves with energy costs

### Battle System

- **Turn-based Combat**: Players alternate turns
- **Energy Management**: Limited energy per turn for moves
- **Team Building**: Up to 6 Pokemon per team
- **Damage Calculation**: Based on attack/defense stats and type effectiveness
- **Battle Rewards**: Winner receives battle fees

### Trading System

- **Offer Creation**: Players can create trading offers
- **Targeted Trading**: Direct offers to specific players
- **Public Trading**: Open offers for anyone to accept
- **Offer Expiration**: Automatic cleanup of expired offers
- **Trading Fees**: Small fee for creating and accepting offers

## Security Considerations

### EVM Security

- **Reentrancy Protection**: Using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
- **Access Control**: Owner-only functions for critical operations
- **Pausable Contracts**: Emergency pause functionality
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Payment Verification**: Proper payment checks for all paid operations

### Solana Security

- **PDA Validation**: Proper Program Derived Address validation
- **Account Ownership**: Verification of account ownership
- **Signer Verification**: Proper signer checks for all operations
- **State Validation**: Comprehensive state validation
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error codes and messages

## Deployment Strategy

### EVM Deployment

1. Deploy PokemonGameFactory contract
2. Factory automatically deploys all game contracts
3. Configure initial game parameters
4. Transfer ownership to governance contract (optional)

### Solana Deployment

1. Build and deploy the Anchor program
2. Initialize the game state
3. Configure initial parameters
4. Deploy to devnet/testnet for testing

## Scalability Considerations

### EVM Scalability

- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient contract design to minimize gas costs
- **Batch Operations**: Support for batch minting and trading
- **Layer 2 Support**: Compatible with L2 solutions
- **Upgradeable Contracts**: Factory pattern allows for upgrades

### Solana Scalability

- **High Throughput**: Solana's high TPS capabilities
- **Low Fees**: Minimal transaction costs
- **Parallel Processing**: Support for concurrent operations
- **Account Optimization**: Efficient account structure

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Tournament System**: Organized competitive play
2. **Guild System**: Team-based gameplay
3. **Cross-Chain Trading**: Bridge between EVM and Solana
4. **Mobile Integration**: Mobile app support
5. **AI Opponents**: Single-player mode with AI
6. **Seasonal Events**: Limited-time cards and events
7. **Staking Rewards**: Earn rewards for holding cards
8. **Governance Token**: Community-driven development

### Technical Improvements

1. **Optimized Gas Usage**: Further gas optimization
2. **Enhanced Security**: Additional security audits
3. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize for better performance
4. **API Integration**: External API for card data
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Game statistics and analytics
6. **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
7. **Documentation**: Detailed API documentation
8. **SDK Development**: Developer SDK for integration

## Conclusion

The Pokemon Card Game architecture provides a robust, scalable, and secure foundation for blockchain-based trading card gameplay. The dual implementation on both EVM and Solana ensures broad accessibility while maintaining the core game mechanics and user experience across both ecosystems.
